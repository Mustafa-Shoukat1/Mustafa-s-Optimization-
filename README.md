# 🧘‍♂️ 2025 Update on Healthy Living Practices


Here’s a minimalist lifestyle checklist for general well-being:

-   🛌 Maintain consistent, high-quality sleep.
-   🚭 Avoid smoking.
-   🏃 Engage in daily movement or exercise.
-   🍬 Limit sugar intake.

These alone can lead to a solid baseline of health. Adjustments can follow based on your personal condition.

## 🧠 Inspiration: Lex Fridman & Huberman Lab

In May 2024, I wrote about Lex Fridman’s daily routine, which inspired personal changes in my schedule. The results were substantial.

Later in the year, I discovered the Rich Roll Podcast featuring Dr. Andrew Huberman, a Stanford neuroscientist. His research-based insights on performance and wellness were eye-opening. I quickly dove into several episodes of the 🎙️ **Huberman Lab Podcast**.

Unlike clickbait health content, Huberman’s approach is grounded in peer-reviewed neuroscience—no gimmicks, no upsells. He offers real, low-cost optimization tools.

## 😴 Sleep Optimization

### 🧬 Biological Foundations

Sleep is the cornerstone of:

-   🧩 Mental focus
-   🧬 Immunity & metabolism
-   😊 Mood stability

Huberman emphasizes the circadian rhythm, governed by light exposure and body temperature. Light—especially sunlight—directly controls your sleep-wake timing via retinal ganglion cells. Temperature also regulates alertness.

### 🔧 Best Practices

-   ☀️ Morning light exposure (2–10 min) resets your biological clock.
-   🌘 Limit light at night—especially blue light—to preserve melatonin and dopamine production.
-   🕯️ Use red/dim lighting or blue-light filters in the evening.
-   🌅 Watching the sunset helps signal the brain to prepare for rest.
-   🧘 Try non-sleep deep rest (NSDR): Yoga Nidra, Headspace, or self-hypnosis.
-   🌡️ Body temperature tricks:
    -   Cold showers 🥶 in the morning advance your rhythm.
    -   Nighttime workouts raise body temp and delay sleep.
-   ☕ Caffeine sensitivity varies. Some tolerate it after 5 PM; others don’t.
-   🚫 Avoid melatonin supplements if possible—regulation is poor and side effects are real.
-   ⏱️ Sleep 6–8 hours for optimal health.

## 🥗 Nutrition & Intermittent Fasting

### 🔍 Scientific Background

Fasting alternates between:

-   🍞 Fed state (growth mode)
-   🛠️ Fasted state (repair & cleansing mode)

Research shows time-restricted eating (e.g., 8-hour windows) enhances:

-   🧪 Cellular cleanup (autophagy)
-   🔥 Fat metabolism
-   💪 Liver & gut health

### 🛠️ Implementation

-   🔰 **Beginner Tip**: No food 1 hour after waking or 2–3 hours before sleep.
-   ⏱️ **Advanced Routine**: Eat within an 8-hour window (e.g., 10 AM–6 PM).
-   💧 Fasting doesn’t mean no liquids: water, tea, and black coffee are allowed.
-   🏃 Light activity after eating helps regulate blood sugar.
-   🧂 Feeling dizzy? Salt water or lemon water helps.

## 🦠 Gut Health

Key learnings:

-   🛡️ Gut microbiota affects immunity and inflammation.
-   🧫 Diversity = resilience.
-   🥬 Fiber helps, but fermented foods (e.g., kefir, kimchi) are even better.
-   ❌ Minimize processed foods and sugar.
-   ⚠️ Probiotics and prebiotics have mixed evidence.

## 🧠 Dopamine, Motivation & Mental Resilience

### 🔬 Core Insights

Dopamine drives:

-   🔋 Motivation
-   🧠 Learning
-   😃 Reward

But it's a limited resource. Overstimulating it (e.g., via social media or video games) leads to:

-   🎢 High highs followed by low lows
-   😩 Dopamine depletion
-   🧨 Burnout or depression

### 📈 Optimize Dopamine Use

-   🎲 Use random reward scheduling (like casinos or games).
-   🚫 Don’t stack rewards (e.g., music + preworkout + socializing + selfies).
-   ✅ Focus on effort as a reward = growth mindset.
-   🧊 Try cold plunges: 2.5× dopamine baseline boost for 3 hours.

### 💊 Triggers & Tools

-   🍫 Chocolate (1.5×)
-   🧬 Nicotine (2.5×)
-   🏃 Exercise (up to 2×)
-   ☕ Caffeine enhances dopamine signaling
-   🧉 Yerba mate = natural, dopamine-friendly stimulant
-   🧬 L-Tyrosine, PEA, Huperzine A: occasional use only (1×/week)

## 📚 Learning, Focus & Brain Optimization

### 🧠 Neuroplasticity

Learning = rewiring neurons. It requires:

-   🧠 Attention
-   ❌ Mistake-based feedback (error signals = learning triggers)
-   💡 New neural connections form during rest and sleep, not during practice.

### 🛠️ Accelerating Learning

-   🔁 Embrace micro-failures. Mistakes activate acetylcholine and dopamine.
-   🛹 Try vestibular stimulation (e.g., balance sports, yoga inversions).
-   🧘 Use physical action to regulate mood: "Mood follows movement."
-   🧪 Combine with:
    -   💭 Growth mindset
    -   😌 Deep breathing (Physiological Sigh)
    -   🎧 Rhythmic learning music

### 👀 Focus & Distraction Control

-   🎯 Focus = toggling between Default Mode and Task Mode
-   🧠 Omega-3 (EPA) enhances attention
-   🧍‍♂️ Physical fidgeting or standing desks aid concentration
-   📵 Avoid content that causes rapid context-switching (e.g., TikTok)
-   🧘 Try a 17-minute guided meditation to rewire attention circuits

## 👵 Longevity Science & Aging Prevention

### 🔬 Aging = Epigenetic Info Loss

Per Harvard’s Dr. David Sinclair:

-   🧬 80% of aging is caused by changes in gene expression (epigenetics), not DNA mutations.
-   Fasting activates sirtuins, improves insulin sensitivity, and cleans old proteins.

### 🔧 Practical Anti-Aging Tools

-   🥗 **Diet**: Focus on plant-based protein & healthy fats. Avoid refined carbs and red meat.
-   🏋️‍♂️ **Exercise**: 3 hrs of cardio + 2–3x/week strength training
-   💊 **Supplements (with caution)**: Omega-3 EPA, resveratrol, NMN, metformin
-   🧬 **Emerging science**: Yamanaka Factors for cellular reprogramming
-   🧪 **Monitor biomarkers**: HbA1c, CRP, LDL, iron levels

## 👨‍💻 My 2025 Personal Practice

-   😴 **Sleep**: Light exposure in morning, avoid screens after 11 PM.
-   ⏰ **Fasting**: 8-hour window with flexible but intentional meals.
-   💊 **Supplements**: Multivitamins, EPA. Considering L-Tyrosine, maybe metformin.
-   🧘 **Focus & Learning**: Standing desk, Yoga Nidra breaks, 30+ min reading daily.
-   🏃‍♂️ **Exercise**: Xiaomi tracker for PAI score, running/badminton 3x/week.
-   🧊 Planning to try mate tea and cold showers in summer.
